Factory Method Pattern

Summary

The program creates different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) dynamically at runtime based on user input.

Structure
- Code/
  - Program.cs — Main driver of the application
  - Document.cs — Interface for document types
  - PdfDocument.cs — Represents a PDF document
  - WordDocument.cs — Represents a Word document
  - ExcelDocument.cs — Represents an Excel document
  - DocumentFactory.cs — Factory class that creates document objects
  - Code.csproj — .NET project file
- Output/
  - output2.png — Screenshot of successful execution
  - out.png- Screenshot of the successful execution of the remaining two ie opening of word and excel.
